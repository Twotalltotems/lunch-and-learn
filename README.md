# Lunch and learn materials

At TTT Studios we're constantly learning about new technologies and ways to improve ourselves.

Lunch and learn is a weekly event at our offices, where someone presents learnings from a project, a new framework, an experience or mostly anything that is worth shareable. 

This repo stores materials from this sessions.
